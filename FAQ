FAQ 1:
Q: Why do I get a "permission denied" when trying to run HTPL files via
the web?
A: HTPL must have a cache for storing compiled scripts. Check the
installation instructions in INSTALL. If you are on a user machine, create
an htpl-cache directory under your web directory, and make it world
writable. This should better be done when HTPL is compiled with dependency
database, to prevent others of munging your files.
