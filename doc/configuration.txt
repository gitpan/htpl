Configuring HTPL:

Main configuration for HTPL is htpl-config.pl in the cgi-bin directory.
Any directory can contain a file called htpl-site.pl to redefine constants
found on htpl-config.pl.

Configuring applications:
Applications can assume a website.ini file (in windows INI format) in the
application directory, which they can access by $config{$section, $key}.
