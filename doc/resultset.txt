Apart of using with macros, resultsets can be used with method calling.

#SQL MYSQL mydb

#SQL CURSOR table SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS

@ids = $table->project('ID');
$table2 = $table->clone;
@two_dim_ary = $table->matrix;
@ary = $table->project(sub {"$id $debth"});
$table2 = $table->filter(sub {$debth > 200;});

@columns = $table->cols;
$num = $table->rows;
$table->access($row_number);
$table->fetch;
$row_number = $table->index;

Resultsets can be queried with the memory SQL engine, if SQL::Statement is
installed.

#MEM CURSOR table2 SELECT ID, DEBTH FROM table WHERE DEBTH = DEPOSITS
