Data sources can be SQL databases via DBI, LDAP directories, comma
delimited files, and multiline flat files.

SQL:

#SQL CONNECT dbi:driver:database
(Check the DBI pod for instructions)
#SQL CURSOR cursorname SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
$var = 10;
#SQL CURSOR crs SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = :var
#SQL EXEC DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
#SQL DECLARE myquery SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = :1 AND PRICE > :price
Later on: 
$price = 10;
#LOAD myquery 24
Will query: SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE ID = 24 AND PRICE > 10
Into cursor myquery.
#SQL IMMEDIATE SELECT DISTINCT price FROM ITEMS WHERE CATEGORY = "cats"
print $price;
#SQL PROJECT ary SELECT ID FROM VENDORS
print join(" ", @ary);
$id = 1; $name = "John"; $last = "Smith";
#SQL INSERT CUSTOMERS id name last
Or simply:
#SQL INSERT CUSTOMERS
$id = 23;
$debth = 100;
#SQL DELETE CUSTOMERS id debth
(And logic)
#SQL QUERY crs CUSTOMERS id age
Same as:
#SQL CURSOR crs SELECT id, age FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE id = :id AND age = :age
Or just:
#SQL CURSOR cursor TABLENAME
To select all fields.


LDAP:
#LDAP INIT ldap.enterprise.net 329 c=fo,o=university,cn=Sven password
#LDAP SEARCH cursor SCOPE=SUB BASE=c=fo,o=university ATTRS=cn \
    FILTER=(&(email=*)(phone=666666))
#LDAP ADD c=fo,o=university,cn=Hans email=hans@yaoo.com cn=Hans
#LDAP DELETE c=fo,o=university,cn=Joe
#LDAP MODIFY c=fo,o=university,cn=Hans email=

Comma delimited:
#TEXT CSV cursor /etc/passwd : user pass uid gid name shell root
#TEXT FLAT cursor data.txt line1 line2 line3
data.txt looks like:
This is line1
This is line2
This is line3

This is also line1
This is also line2
This is also line3


#TEXT READ var http://www.yahoo.com
print $var;

For all result sets:
#FETCH cursor
print "Field 'x' is $x\n";
#LOOP
